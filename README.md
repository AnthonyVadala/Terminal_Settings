- [Brewfile](https://github.com/AnthonyVadala/Terminal_Settings/blob/main/Terminal/Brewfile) What I brew on my system! If you don't Homebrew get it [here](https://brew.sh/)!
- [Caskfile](https://github.com/AnthonyVadala/Terminal_Settings/blob/main/Terminal/Caskfile) Extend Homebrew's capabilities to install macOS applications! Get it [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask)!
